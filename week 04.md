# Plutus Pioneer Week 04

This week focusses on Monads and running a Plutus simulation using the command line rather than the browser.

The first half of the video is very well presented but the second half is a lot tougher to follow. However I highly recommend reading my [annotated version](/pioneer/week04/src/Week04/Contract.hs) of the contracts.hs file

The [Homework solution](/pioneer/week04/src/Week04/Homework.hs) is fairly straightforward once you understand the Contract.hs file.
